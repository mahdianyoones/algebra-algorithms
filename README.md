The purpose of this repository is to implement elementary algebraic algorithms for educational purposes. Feel free to study the scripts written in Python and use them in whatever way you want.

If you're keen to understand the algorithms deeply, study the [pre-algebrav2.0](https://openstax.org/details/books/prealgebra-2e) free book.
